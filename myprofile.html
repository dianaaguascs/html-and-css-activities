        <section id="bio"><p>Hi, my name is Diana Aguas-Chantes. I am 22 years old, and I am so in love with science and arts.
            I want to dedicate my professional career to the development of science and technology,
            but whenever I get to be free I am dedicating my time and soul to create and make music. </p>

            here is a big block of text illustrating the usage of the text alight justify settings. As you can see
            it stretches the white space between the words so that the left and right edges of the paragraph git well
            within a box. This can help your text look cleaner than a simple left alignment. Note that
            it does not stretch out the final line in the paragraph.
        </p>
        <h3 id="onedottwo">This header's line height is stretched to 1.2</h3>
        <h4 id="baseline">This header is aligned to the baseline of the line height within a stretched containing box</h4>

                This height is also set to 25%, and since it's within a div containing
            block who has set height of 500px this p will resize in relation to that
